Thank you for downloading my first android project, the Statosphere!!
The purpose of this app is to provide an easy way to look up statistical data
on football teams and players in the NFL. The idea going forward is to add more in depth player comparison
features to assist with fantasy football and sports betting decisions, but for now we just have simple
look-up and comparison capabilities (and not to mention a decent HTML scraper, but that mostly goes
on in the background!). 


USER GUIDE:

When you first install the app, you will want to click the Download Database button, which
should be the farthest to the right on the top toolbar. Unfortunately downloading the team and player 
data takes a short while. However, the app will continue to fetch data in the background, just don't
close the app before it's finished writing to the database. After the app is done, you'll receive a toast
to alert you that the database is ready to go. If you're unsure as to whether or not the app's data is ready,
simply click the Download Database button again. If no update is necessary, a toast will notify you. Otherwise,
the database will begin to update.

From this point on and everytime you open the app back up, the navigation of the app is pretty straight forward.

The Compare Teams Button will take you to a list of all of the NFL teams that you can scroll through. Upon selecting
a team to view, you can also page left and right through the other teams to quickly compare them all. Pressing back 
will return you to the list, which has check box's in case you lose your place. Press back again and you'll be back
at the launch page.

The Compare Players Button takes you to the Player Comparison Tool. To populate the tool with players, press the button
in the right corner of the top toolbar. A dialog will prompt you to enter the names of players you would like to compare.
If one of the player names is entered incorrectly, you will be prompted to enter the names again. You can, however, use
the back button to retreat back to the blank Comparison Tool, and clicking back one more time brings you back to launch.
After the dialog concludes successfully, the screen should update with a side by side comparison of each player's stats.
Pressing the back button will bring you back to the launch screen from here.

The Search Teams and Players Button is a basic search function for looking up players or teams individually. After entering
a team or player name, pressing search will display their information individually. Pressing back once will bring you back 
to the search page, and once again to return to the launch page.



If you're not a huge football nerd like I am, here are some teams and players to try looking up so you can try out the app:

Julio Jones
Jarvis Landry
Philadelphia Eagles





That should be all the information you need to get started on my application. Thank you for checking it out, and feel free to 
dig into the source code if you want to know more! Keep in mind this was a solo class project, so while it was made with future
updates in mind, I only guarantee consistent updates and functionality on and around May 13th, 2019. 

Many of the Unit Tests/demands of Test Driven Development being applied to this program in particular went outside the scope
